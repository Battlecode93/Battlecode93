<h1> Hello, I'm Corey </h1>

<p> I've built some projects dealing with real-world architectures and best practices. My work ranges from serverless applications, CI/CD pipelines, Terraform, and 3 tier-web applications. They are designed to demonstrate secure, scalable, and cost-efficient cloud solutions with clear documentation to reflect how they’d be implemented in production environments. </p>
