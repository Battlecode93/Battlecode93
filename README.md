<h1> Hello, I'm Corey! </h1>

As an aspiring AWS Cloud Engineer, I have successfully completed seven projects and am dedicated to continually expanding my knowledge of AWS services. My expertise includes microservices architecture, serverless computing with AWS Lambda, and CI/CD principles. I have hands-on experience with VPCs, networking, and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Terraform. Through my projects, I have developed scalable, secure, and cost-efficient cloud solutions, adhering to best practices in automation and deployment. I am committed to ongoing learning to stay current with AWS innovations and enhance my technical proficiency.
